  title: "About Me"
  description: "Hi, I’m a Senior Application Engineer who enjoys building systems that make developers’ lives easier. I started out studying psychology, which gave me a deep understanding of how people think and solve problems. That perspective now informs the tools, pipelines, and infrastructure I create to help teams work more efficiently."
  content: "I’ve worked across the full stack, from frontends to backends, and now focus on cloud-native systems that help teams ship faster with confidence. I’m proactive, a fast learner, and I take pride in creating solutions that combine stability with speed. And yes, I do it all with a strong cup of coffee in hand. ☕"

  description: "I’ve completed both half and full marathons, so endurance and focus are strengths in both code and life. I love backpacking and kayaking with my husband and our dogs, and I’m a big fan of The Office and Stranger Things — balance matters, even for engineers. And of course, I start every debugging session with a good cup of coffee. Always. ☕"
