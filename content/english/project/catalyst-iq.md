Catalyst IQ — Marketing Website Design & Development

Catalyst IQ is a data-driven consulting and analytics company that needed a modern, professional marketing website to showcase their services and thought leadership. The primary goal was to design a clean, high-performing website that could be easily managed and updated by their internal marketing team without requiring ongoing developer support.

<br/>

The project began with wireframing and interface design in Figma, focusing on clarity, credibility, and conversion. The visual language emphasized Catalyst IQ’s analytical expertise through structured layouts, strong typography, and balanced use of whitespace. The result was a design that communicated trust and innovation while remaining visually minimal and approachable.

<br/>

The site was developed using **Hugo**, a fast and flexible static site generator, chosen for its performance, scalability, and simplicity of content management. **Tailwind CSS** was used to implement a consistent, responsive design system that allowed for rapid development and easy visual customization. Reusable components were built for sections like case studies, services, and team profiles—making content updates simple and efficient.

<br/>

To streamline the content workflow, a modular content architecture was implemented, allowing the Catalyst IQ team to edit text, images, and calls-to-action directly within Hugo’s configuration files. This eliminated dependency on complex CMS systems while keeping content updates lightweight and fast.

<br/>

Key features include:
- Lightning-fast static architecture built with Hugo  
- Fully responsive, accessible layouts built with Tailwind CSS  
- Modular content structure for easy updates  
- Optimized performance and SEO  
- Scalable design system for future page additions  

<br/>

The final product delivered a highly performant, easy-to-maintain marketing site that aligned with Catalyst IQ’s brand goals. By combining design precision with technical efficiency, the site empowered the client’s team to manage their online presence confidently and independently—without sacrificing quality or scalability.
