Women in STEM is a concept for a web-based social platform designed to connect, inspire, and support women across the fields of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. This project was developed as part of the Google UX Design Certificate and followed a full UX design process — from initial problem framing and user research to wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing with real users.

<br/>

The goal of Women in STEM was to address the isolation and underrepresentation many women experience in technical and scientific fields. Existing professional platforms often feel impersonal or competitive, while general social media lacks targeted networking tools. Women in STEAM sought to fill this gap by creating a dedicated space for women to share achievements, find mentors, and build meaningful professional relationships in a supportive environment.

<br/>

User research included online surveys and interviews with women currently working or studying in STEM disciplines. Five participants were also involved in a usability study of the interactive prototype. Key insights from research highlighted that users valued mentorship opportunities, resource sharing, and safe community spaces for professional discussion. They also desired a simple, clean interface that prioritized connection over competition.

<br/>

Early low-fidelity wireframes focused on core user journeys: creating a profile, joining interest-based groups, posting updates, and engaging in mentorship programs. These initial designs prioritized accessibility, clear navigation, and visual balance between personal expression and professional networking.

<br/>

High-fidelity mockups were created in Figma, featuring a modern yet welcoming aesthetic — clean lines, soft contrast, and an empowering color palette inspired by inclusivity and collaboration. The design system emphasized readability, visual consistency, and the use of imagery that reflected diverse women in STEAM roles.

<br/>

Usability testing with five women in STEM provided valuable feedback on clarity and usability. Participants appreciated the encouraging tone and intuitive layout, but suggested improvements such as clearer onboarding guidance and the ability to filter community posts by discipline or experience level. These findings informed key design refinements, enhancing both usability and user engagement.

<br/>

Best Design Practices Followed:
- Human-centered research grounded in empathy and inclusivity  
- Accessible color palette and responsive layouts  
- Clear visual hierarchy and consistent design system  
- Iterative improvements based on user feedback and testing  
- Emphasis on community, mentorship, and authentic representation  

<br/>

Women in STEM demonstrates how thoughtful UX design can empower underrepresented communities by fostering belonging and connection. The project highlights the importance of designing digital spaces that not only inform but also inspire. Through intentional design choices and user-centered iteration, Women in STEM shows how technology can help build stronger networks for women across disciplines — turning shared experiences into shared opportunities.

<br/>

Future directions for this project include expanding mentorship features, integrating live event tools for networking sessions, and developing a mobile-friendly experience to reach a wider audience. Women in STEM stands as an example of inclusive, purpose-driven design that brings people together through shared passions and goals.
