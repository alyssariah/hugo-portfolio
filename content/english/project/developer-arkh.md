ARKH Developer Program — Website Design & Development

ARKH, a company focused on immersive technology and developer tools, needed a dedicated website to introduce their new Developer Program. The platform’s goal was to provide clear program details, highlight partner benefits, and collect developer applications through a dynamic and secure submission process.

<br/>

The project began with a UX-driven design phase in Figma to establish the site’s structure, hierarchy, and visual tone. The design focused on clarity, professionalism, and forward-thinking aesthetics that matched ARKH’s brand and mission. Each section of the site was tailored to effectively communicate key information—program overview, benefits, technical documentation, and an integrated application portal.

<br/>

The website was developed using **Next.js** for its high performance, scalability, and server-side rendering capabilities, ensuring fast load times and optimal SEO. **Tailwind CSS** was used to build a clean, consistent, and fully responsive UI with reusable design components for maintainability and future expansion.

<br/>

A custom **application submission system** was built using a **GraphQL API endpoint** connected to a backend database. This allowed ARKH to securely collect, query, and manage incoming developer applications in real time. The system included form validation, automated responses, and streamlined data flow to ensure a smooth experience for applicants and administrators alike.

<br/>

To support continuous delivery, a **CI/CD pipeline** was established using GitHub Actions and Vercel. This automated workflow allowed the ARKH team to deploy updates instantly—improving development speed and maintaining reliability throughout the product lifecycle.

<br/>

Key features include:
- Program introduction pages designed for clarity and engagement  
- Custom GraphQL API integration for application submissions  
- Responsive, modern design built with Tailwind CSS  
- Next.js architecture for scalability and SEO optimization  
- CI/CD automation for seamless updates and deployment  

<br/>

The final site positioned ARKH as a forward-thinking technology leader, providing developers with an intuitive platform to learn about the program and apply directly. With its combination of speed, flexibility, and scalability, the ARKH Developer Program website serves as a strong foundation for future community and platform growth.
