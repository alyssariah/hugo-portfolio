Delano Bats — eCommerce Website Design & Development

Delano Bats, a sports equipment company specializing in advanced baseball bat technology, needed a modern website to launch their first product line and showcase their innovation in bat design. The goal was to create a visually striking, performance-driven eCommerce platform that could grow alongside the brand and seamlessly handle online sales.

<br/>
<br/>

The project began with a design exploration in Figma, focusing on establishing a strong visual identity that reflected Delano’s dedication to precision and craftsmanship. The UI emphasized bold imagery, clean typography, and a high-contrast color palette to mirror the sleek design of their new bat technology. The user experience was crafted to highlight product performance details while maintaining a frictionless shopping journey.

<br/>

The website was built using **Next.js** for speed, scalability, and SEO optimization, with **BigCommerce** integrated as the eCommerce backend to manage inventory, payments, and orders. **ButterCMS** was implemented as the headless content management system, giving the Delano team complete control over pages, product stories, and marketing content without relying on developers. **Tailwind CSS** was used to ensure a consistent, responsive, and efficient design system across the entire site.

<br/>

A **CI/CD pipeline** was set up using GitHub Actions and Vercel, enabling automated builds and deployments. This workflow ensures that new content and updates are delivered quickly and reliably, supporting continuous growth and a smooth product rollout.

<br/>

Key features include:
- Integrated eCommerce functionality powered by BigCommerce  
- Dynamic content management through ButterCMS  
- Fast, responsive, and SEO-optimized architecture with Next.js  
- Tailwind CSS component library for scalable design consistency  
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for continual deployment  

<br/>

The final result is a high-performance, user-friendly eCommerce platform that effectively communicates Delano Bats’ innovation and craftsmanship. The site not only supports product sales but also strengthens the brand’s online presence, laying the foundation for future product launches and digital marketing initiatives.
