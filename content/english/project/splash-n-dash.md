Splash n Dash K9 Training Club — Website Redesign & Development

Splash n Dash is a professional dog training club that needed a complete website overhaul to better showcase their services, trainers, and training philosophy. The goal of the project was to create a vibrant, user-friendly platform that reflected the club’s energy and made it simple for staff to update content without technical assistance.
<br/>
<br/>
The design process began with a brand refresh, focusing on a clean and friendly aesthetic that balanced professionalism with approachability. Using Figma for wireframes and visual design, I created a responsive layout emphasizing clear navigation, engaging imagery, and strong calls-to-action.
<br/>
<br />
The website was developed using Next.js for its performance, scalability, and SEO advantages, integrated with Sanity CMS to provide a flexible, headless content management system. This setup allows the client to easily manage class schedules, trainer bios, and blog content in real time.
<br/>
<br/>
Key features include a fully responsive and accessible interface optimized for all devices, dynamic content powered by Sanity CMS, optimized image handling with SEO-friendly architecture, and automated builds and deployments through a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Vercel.
<br/>
<br/>
The redesign significantly improved user engagement and content management efficiency. The automated deployment pipeline ensures updates are delivered seamlessly, while the new architecture provides long-term maintainability and performance.
