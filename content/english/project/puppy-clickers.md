Puppy Clickers is a concept for a dog training website that uses positive reinforcement and clickers as training markers to help owners build better habits with their pets. This project was developed as part of the Google UX Design Certificate, following the full UX design process—from research and ideation to high-fidelity mockups and usability testing.

<br/>

Many dog training resources online are cluttered, inconsistent, or overly technical, which can discourage beginners. Puppy Clickers aimed to simplify the learning experience by creating a warm, structured, and easy-to-follow platform for dog owners who want to train effectively using humane methods.

<br/>

Low-fidelity wireframes established the main user flow—learning, practicing, and rewarding good behavior through a digital “clicker” system. These early prototypes focused on simplicity, clarity, and user motivation.

<br/>

High-fidelity mockups were then created in Figma, emphasizing an inviting color palette, friendly typography, and intuitive layouts. Rounded shapes and consistent spacing reflected the positive, approachable nature of the brand. The design prioritized accessibility, ensuring adequate contrast and large, easy-to-tap interactive elements.

<br/>

Five participants tested the prototype by completing common actions like starting a training session, marking progress, and reviewing achievements. Feedback indicated that the interface was enjoyable and easy to navigate. Areas for improvement included adding onboarding tips and clearer progress visuals. Iterations were made to improve clarity and enhance the feedback loop after each successful training session.

<br/>

Best Design Practices Followed:
- Accessible color contrast and touch-friendly components  
- Consistent design system and iconography  
- Positive feedback through visuals and microinteractions  
- Iterative design improvements based on usability testing  

<br/>

Puppy Clickers successfully demonstrated how UX design principles can transform complex training methods into an engaging, user-friendly experience. The website concept balances education and enjoyment—mirroring the philosophy of positive reinforcement in both training content and design approach.

<br/>
Future possibilities include adding community features, personalized training plans, and integrations with wearable clickers for real-time feedback. Puppy Clickers stands as an example of how thoughtful, user-centered design can help people and their pets learn and grow together.
